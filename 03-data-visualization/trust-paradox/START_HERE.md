## 🎯 The Core Idea (30 seconds)

**The Trust Paradox** shows that:

1. **Heavy security alone doesn't create sustainable peace**  
   ❌ Security suppresses violence (good)  
   ❌ But erodes trust if excessive (bad for sustainability)

2. **Trust alone isn't enough**  
   ✅ Trust enables cooperation (good)  
   ✅ But without enforcement, vulnerable to predators (risky)

3. **Institutions bridge the gap**  
   ✅ Fair institutions earn trust  
   ✅ Legitimate institutions can enforce rules without oppression

**Solution**: Balance all three dimensions for sustainable peace.

## 📊 What The Model Measures

Three dimensions (0–100 scale):
- **Trust (T)**: Do people trust each other & the government?
- **Security (S)**: How much enforcement, surveillance, protection?
- **Institutions (I)**: How fair, inclusive, capable?

Three outputs (0–100 scale):
- **Negative Peace**: Absence of violence (mainly security + institutions)
- **Positive Peace**: Presence of justice & wellbeing (mainly trust + institutions)
- **Sustainability**: Resilience to shocks (balance across all three)

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: How long will this take?**  
A: 5 minutes to explore; 20 min to understand; 2+ hours to apply; 2+ weeks to research deeply.

**Q: Do I need to code?**  
A: No—interactive tool is web-based. Yes—if you want to do analysis in Python/Jupyter.

**Q: Can I use this in my research/publication?**  
A: Yes! See [README.md](README.md) § "Citation" + [ACADEMIC_REFERENCES.md](ACADEMIC_REFERENCES.md) for grounding.

**Q: Is this peer-reviewed?**  
A: The model is grounded in 39+ peer-reviewed sources (see [ACADEMIC_REFERENCES.md](ACADEMIC_REFERENCES.md)). The model itself is a framework tool, not empirical research.

**Q: Can I adapt this for my country/organization?**  
A: Yes! See [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) § D.
