## 🎯 The Core Idea (30 seconds)

**The Polarization Spiral** shows that:

1. **Media fragmentation creates silos**  
   ❌ People see fewer viewpoints  
   ❌ No shared reality across communities

2. **Algorithms amplify extremes**  
   ❌ Echo chambers reinforce existing beliefs  
   ❌ Radical content gets boosted

3. **Without dialogue, polarization spirals**  
   ✅ Cross-community contact is the antidote  
   ✅ Regular dialogue can reverse the spiral

**Solution**: Maintain media diversity, regulate algorithms, foster genuine dialogue across divides.

## 📊 What The Model Measures

Three drivers (0–100 scale):
- **Media Fragmentation (F)**: How siloed are information sources?
- **Echo Chamber Strength (E)**: How much do algorithms amplify extremes?
- **Cross-Community Dialogue (D)**: How much do communities talk across divides?

Four outputs (0–100 scale):
- **Polarization Index**: How far apart communities are
- **Information Diversity**: Variety of viewpoints people encounter
- **Cross-Community Understanding**: Empathy and shared knowledge
- **Conflict Likelihood**: Risk of escalation

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: How long will this take?**  
A: 5 minutes to explore; 20 min to understand; 2+ hours to apply; 2+ weeks to research deeply.

**Q: Do I need to code?**  
A: No—interactive tool is web-based. Yes—if you want to do analysis in Python/Jupyter.

**Q: Can I use this in my research/publication?**  
A: Yes! See [README.md](README.md) § "Citation" + [ACADEMIC_REFERENCES.md](ACADEMIC_REFERENCES.md) for grounding.

**Q: Is this peer-reviewed?**  
A: The model is grounded in 35+ peer-reviewed sources (see [ACADEMIC_REFERENCES.md](ACADEMIC_REFERENCES.md)). The model itself is a framework tool, not empirical research.

**Q: Can I adapt this for my community/organization?**  
A: Yes! See [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) § D.
